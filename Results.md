# Results<br />

## Methods<br />

•	The Game of Life code was implemented in the three programming languages. (Rust, Go and Scala). <br />
•	Bugs were introduced in these three codes so that the participants can try to debug the codes in a limited amount of time. The steps to do the testing were mentioned in the Readme.md in our Github repository.<br />
•	A google sheet is created for the participants to enroll with their names and the preferred time slots for testing.<br />
•	We used Google sheets to collect the data of the participants and their observations after they performed the experiment.<br />

## Materials<br />

•	Online compiler links were provided to the participants for the easy testing of our codes.<br />
•	[Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dc-u9gUTlp9lGXloCC8Ct1ruAwqNz8RcXk8BVhFY1uQ/edit#gid=0)<br />


## Observations<br />

The following three graphs show how many of the participants were able to find the bug in three of the codes.

The bar graph shows how much time each participant spent on trying to debug each of the codes.

The pie chart shows the average time spent to debug in all the three languages.

## Conclusions<br />

•	From the observations it is evident that most of the participants found the code in Scala harder to debug compared to Go and Rust.<br />
•	Most of the participants found bugs present in the Go and Rust codes for the Game of Life and were unable to find the bugs in Scala.<br />
•	Most of the participants completed the testing around 25-40 minutes.<br />

## Threats to Validity <br />	

•	The bugs introduced in three of the codes were of different types and it is possible that a bug in a particular code is harder to debug than the bugs present in the remaining two codes. <br />
•	Lack of pre-testing to make sure that the debugging of all three of the codes can be completed in under 30 minutes.<br />
•	Familiarity of the languages by few participants before-hand helped them debug the codes faster compared to other participants and comparing their observations to that of others might not be an effective way to draw the right conclusions.<br />
• The data collected is not sufficient enough to draw strong conclusions.<br />

Results

Methods

•	The Game of Life code was implemented in the three programming languages. (Rust, Go and Scala). 
•	Bugs were introduced in these three codes so that the participants can try to debug the codes in a limited amount of time. The steps to do the testing were mentioned in the Readme.md in our Github repository.
•	A google sheet is created for the participants to enroll with their names and the preferred time slots for testing.
•	We used Google sheets to collect the data of the participants and their observations after they performed the experiment.

Materials

•	Online compiler links were provided to the participants for the easy testing of our codes.
•	Google sheet 


Observations

Conclusions

•	From the observations it is evident that most of the participants found the code in Scala harder to debug compared to Go and Rust.
•	Most of the participants found bugs present in the Go and Rust codes for the Game of Life and were unable to find the bugs in Scala.
•	Most of the participants completed the testing around 25-40 minutes.

Threats to Validity 	

•	The bugs introduced in three of the codes were of different types and it is possible that a bug in a particular code is harder to debug than the bugs present in the remaining two codes. 
•	Lack of pre-testing to make sure that the debugging of all three of the codes can be completed in under 30 minutes.
•	Familiarity of the languages by few participants before-hand helped them debug the codes faster compared to other participants and comparing their observations to that of others might not be an effective way to draw the right conclusions.
